# Transmog Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development trajectory for Transmog.

## Current Features

Transmog currently provides the following capabilities:

- JSON flattening and normalization
- Nested array extraction to separate tables
- Multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet)
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Metadata generation
- Deterministic ID generation
- Memory-optimized processing for large datasets

## Short-term Goals (0-3 months)

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Improve memory efficiency for very large datasets
   - Implement lazy loading for large input files
   - Optimize array extraction for high-cardinality data

2. **Extended Format Support**
   - Add support for Apache Arrow IPC format
   - Implement direct database export connectors
   - Support for hierarchical Parquet datasets

3. **Enhanced Schema Features**
   - Schema inference and validation
   - Type casting and normalization
   - Support for complex validation rules

## Mid-term Goals (3-6 months)

1. **Advanced Transformation Features**
   - Custom value transformation hooks
   - Path-based transformation rules
   - Conditional processing logic

2. **Streaming Capabilities**
   - Stream processing for infinite data sources
   - Checkpoint support for resumable processing
   - Back-pressure handling for data pipelines

3. **Integration Improvements**
   - Native integrations with popular data processing frameworks
   - Cloud storage support (S3, GCS, Azure)
   - Container-friendly configuration

## Long-term Vision (6+ months)

1. **Distributed Processing**
   - Support for distributed workloads
   - Integration with processing frameworks (Spark, Dask)
   - Sharding and partitioning strategies

2. **Ecosystem Development**
   - Extension framework for custom processors
   - Plugin system for format handlers
   - Community-contributed transformers

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - Data lineage tracking
   - Compliance and audit capabilities
   - Enhanced security features
